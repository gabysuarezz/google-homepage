# Welcome to my Google Homepage Clone!
## Overview
In this exercise I'll be cloning Google's homepage to put in practice what I've learned in our HTML, CSS, and Git lessons of The Odin Project.
## What I expect to learn
I expect to be able to play with the Chrome Dev Tools to replicate this page, as well as use HTML and CSS to modify my page as needed. I also expect to cement my Git knowledge.
## What I've learned
I'll fill this out once I'm done with the project
